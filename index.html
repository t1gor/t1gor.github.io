    		<h1>Hi!</h1>
    		<p>My name is <span class="hl">Igor</span> and I'm a <span class="hl">web developer</span>. <span class="grey">(No, this is not an AA meeting!)</span></p>
    		<div class="message info"><i class="flag flag-ru"></i> Эта страница так же доступна на русском языке - вот <a href="/ru">тут</a>.</div>
    		<p>A bunch of my friends lately are asking a lot of questions like:</p>
    		<figure class="two-column">
    			<blockquote class="quote">I would like to do some web-development ... but I'm not sure where to start with ... can you help, please?</blockquote>
    			<blockquote class="quote">Web development seems to be pretty easy and well-payed. And you ARE a one - can you teach me?</blockquote>
    		</figure>
    		<p>Unfortunately <del>(or not)</del>, I am not a teacher, so can't really teach you in a common way. The good news is that we have internet! And there is this buzz on remote/online education lately, which means you can literally learn for free from the best universities around the world. All I can do here is forward you guys a little bit.</p>
    		<p>I'm going to start posting varios links to education resources for people willing to do web-development in <a href="/learning-web-dev" class="hl">Learning</a> section here. I will do my best to structure it in a way to make it easier to understand for newbie's, so if you think that something is missing or way too complex - please feel free to write a comment.</p>
    		<p>If there is something specific that you're struggling with and you think I might know how to solve that - just let me know via comment or private message and I will try to help, if I can of course.</p>
